        between you and us for the sale of Goods to you and your use of the Ucard Features. These Terms and Conditions of Business,
        which include our Privacy Policy, and Special Conditions constitute the entire contract between you and us to the exclusion of

        without prior notice. The images of the Goods in the Ucard Features are for illustrative purposes only. We use our reasonable
        endeavours to make sure that all Goods featured in the Ucard Features are shown accurately. However, occasionally there maybe small
        variations in colour, typefaces and layout and we cannot guarantee that your computer’s display of the colours accurately reflect
        the colour of the Goods as received. Your Goods may therefore vary slightly from those images.<br>
        d. The Seller endeavours to display and describe as accurately as possible the printed colours of the Printed Goods which appear on
        its app, but cannot undertake to give any assurance that the colours of Printed Goods supplied will exactly match those displayed
        on the Buyer’s monitor.<br>
        e. Prior to producing Printed Goods, we make an electronic preview of the Product available for your review. Proceeding to the mail
        Ucard screen is deemed acceptance by you of the product. You are responsible for approving the preview, due to their personalised,
        bespoke nature, the Printed Goods cannot be changed nor cancelled. We shall have no liability to you for any errors in the text,
        pictures or layout of the Printed Goods subsequently discovered by you.<br>
        f. In respect of submitted products, we shall meet your colour requirements where files are submitted in CMYK format in respect of
        the Printed Goods. You accept that variations in colours are inherent within the printing process for files submitted in other
        formats. You also understand and accept that computer hardware set ups are such that we cannot guarantee that the Product colours
        will match those displayed on your device screen during the ordering process.<br><br>
        
        4. Price, Payment and Currencies<br><br>
        a. All prices are exclusive of Delivery Costs (if applicable). The Buyer shall be responsible for any other taxes applicable in the
        territory where the Goods are received.<br>
        b. The price of any Goods will be as quoted on our App and/or Sites from time to time, except in cases of obvious error.<br>
        c. Payment must be made by credit card, debit card or any other electronic payment facility as provided at the time of placing an
        Order which is accepted by the Seller. Payment in full will be taken at this time and the Contract will be in force.<br>
        d. The Buyer undertakes that all details provided to the Seller for the purpose of the Order and its delivery will be correct
        and that the chosen method of payment is the property of the Seller and that sufficient funds or credit facilities are available
        to cover the full cost of the Goods ordered. The Seller reserves the right to obtain validation of the Buyer’s credit card, debit
        card details before accepting the Buyer’s Order.<br>

        they may be subject to import duties and taxes which are levied upon receipt of the Goods. You will be responsible for payment of
        any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please
        contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order.<br>
        f. Please also note that you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the products are destined.
        We will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws.<br>

        any given time. Offers or discounts may not be valid on international delivery.<br><br>

        agreed otherwise) shall be regular postage.<br>
        b. The Seller will endeavour to process an Order and manufacture Printed Goods within the time period stated for each item. However
        manufacturing time varies by item of Printed Goods and it is the policy of the Seller to combine items of the same type into separate
        shipping packages. Each package of like items will be sent separately by regular post, unless otherwise stated in the Order
        Confirmation as soon as it is completed. Any dates quoted for delivery of the Printed Goods are indicative only. Time for delivery
        will not be of the essence of the Contract and the Seller will not be liable for any loss or expenses sustained by the Buyer arising
        from any delay in the delivery of the Printed Goods howsoever caused.<br>
        c. The Buyer must inspect the Printed Goods on delivery and, in the case where Printed Goods have been delivered by carrier, sign the
        required proof of delivery document or collection acceptance document. A signature on that document will constitute conclusive evidence
        against the Buyer of receipt of the quantity of Printed Goods indicated on that document free from any apparent defect or damage The
        Buyer may not reject the Printed Goods or any part of them solely on the grounds of short delivery of an instalment. If the Printed
        Goods are alleged to be damaged or defective on delivery, a description of the alleged damage or defect must be given in writing at
        the time of delivery and signed by or on behalf of the Buyer.<br>
        d. The Seller reserves the right to make delivery of the Printed Goods and any other Goods by instalments. If the Goods are to be
        delivered in instalments, each delivery will constitute a separate contract. The Buyer may not treat the Contract (as a whole) as
        repudiated if the Seller fails to deliver any one or more of the instalments or if the Buyer has a claim in respect of any one or
        more of the instalments.<br>
        e. If the Buyer wrongfully fails to take delivery of the Printed Goods, the Seller shall be under no obligation to refund the Price<br>
        f. Printed Goods may not be returned to the Seller except as provided in Condition 7 below.<br>
        g. Where delivery is not possible as a result of us being provided with the incorrect delivery address details, our delivery service
        will return the Printed Goods to us. We reserve the right to make an additional delivery charge for re-despatch of the Printed Goods
        to the correct delivery address.<br><br>
        
        6. Risk and Property<br><br>
        a. Risk of damage to or loss of the Printed Goods will pass to the Buyer on delivery at the agreed address.<br>
        b. Notwithstanding delivery and the passing of risk in the Printed Goods, property in the Printed Goods will not pass from the Seller
        until the Seller has received full payment of the Price and all other sums which are due, owing or payable by the Buyer to the Seller
        in respect of the Contract or any other Contract between the Seller and the Buyer.<br><br>
        
        ​7. Returns, Refunds and Rights of Cancellation for Printed Goods<br><br>
        a. The Buyer shall have the right to cancel any Order for Printed Goods only in the following circumstances:<br>
         (i) if the Seller has failed to deliver the Printed Goods ordered within 28 days after the date of the Order<br>
         (ii) in the case of Faulty Goods at the earliest opportunity after the Buyer has discovered the fault or defect (provided that the
         Buyer shall be deemed to have inspected the Printed Goods as soon as reasonably practicable after delivery and in no case longer
         than 14 days after receipt).<br>
        b. Notice of the wish to cancel must be made by email to support@ucardstore.com<br>
        c. For the avoidance of doubt, save in respect of faulty or defective goods, nothing in these Terms and Conditions of Business shall
        give to the Buyer rights of cancellation in regard to the Printed Goods which, by their nature have been made to the Buyer’s
        specifications or clearly personalised.<br>
        d. In the case of cancellation under Condition 7(a) above, the Seller shall be responsible for all sums paid (including initial and re-
        delivery charges (if any)) in respect of the Printed Goods in question.<br>
        e. All items of Printed Goods which are returned by the Buyer to the Seller must be returned in their original packaging (which the Buyer
        should retain for the purpose) and must be in an unused condition.<br><br>
        
        8. Subscriptions<br><br>
        a. The current fee for Subscription, as described by the Seller in the App and/or Sites will be automatically and immediately charged to
        your account on the date that you complete your Order for a Subscription.<br>
        b. Subscription payment occurs on a pre-pay basis.<br>
        c. Buyers using the Apple iOS Application will be charged for Subscriptions through their iTunes account at the confirmation of
        their Order. The Subscriptions can be managed and renewed in My Subscription available through the App Menu.<br>
        d. If you renew your Subscription prior to its expiration date, the new Subscription expiration date will be extended by one period
        from the current expiration date. The Seller will notify the Buyer of the time remaining until expiry if the Buyer logs into the App
        within 5 days of expiry and the Seller will provide an opportunity to renew the Subscription. If you fail to renew your Subscription
        prior to its expiration, you will no longer have access to those services and will need to purchase another Subscription.<br>
        e. Unless the Seller gives an explicit note to the contrary, Subscription Orders are non-refundable. No cancellation of the current
        Subscription is allowed during active Subscription period.<br>
        f. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a new Subscription.<br><br>

        (i) Any notice given or made under the Contract must be in writing (other than writing on the screen of a visual display unit or other
        similar device, which shall not be treated as writing for the purposes of this Condition).<br>
        (ii) A notice served on the Seller will be addressed as provided in Condition 9(e) and on the Buyer at the address stated on the Order,
        and if so addressed, will be deemed to have been duly given or made as follows:<br>
        * if sent by personal delivery, upon delivery at the address of the relevant party; or * if sent by first class post, two clear
        business days after the date of posting.<br>
        (iii) The Seller and the Buyer may notify each other of a change in their name, relevant addressee and address for the purpose of this
        Condition and this notification will only be effective on:<br>
        * the date specified as the date on which the change is to take place; or * if no date is specified or the date specified is less than
        five clear business days after the date on which notice is given, the date falling five clear business days after notice of any change
        has been given.<br>
        (iv) This Condition will not apply in relation to the formal service of any court documentation or other document arising in connection
        with any disputes under the Contract.<br>

        (ii) The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of Ireland are to have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may
        arise in connection with the Contract.<br>
        c. Waiver<br>
        If the Seller does not exercise a right or power when it is able to do so this will not prevent it exercising that right or power.
        When it does exercise a right or power it may do so again in the same or a different manner.<br>
        d. Statutory Rights<br>
        The rights of the Seller and the Buyer and remedies under the Contract are additional to and not in derogation of, any other rights
        and remedies they may have at law.<br>
        e. Severability<br>
        If any term or provision in the Contract is found to be void, against public policy, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction
        and such finding or order becomes final with all appeals exhausted, then the offending provision shall be deemed modified to the extent
        necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If the offending provision cannot be so modified, then the same shall be deemed stricken from
        the Contract in its entirety, and the remainder of the Contract shall survive with the said offending provision eliminated.<br>
        f. App Availability<br>
        Because public networks, such as the internet, occasionally experience disruptions, the Seller cannot guarantee the Ucard app will
        be available 100% of the time. Although the Seller strives to provide the most reliable app possible, interruptions and delays in
        accessing the app are unavoidable and the Seller disclaims any liability for damages resulting from such problems.<br>
        g. Typographical Errors<br>
        Information on Ucard app may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. The Seller attempts to make its descriptions
        as accurate as possible, but does not warrant that the content of the Ucard app is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.<br>
        h. Licence<br>
        The Seller grants to the Buyer a limited personal, non-exclusive, and non-transferable right to access and use the content on the
        Ucard app. All use must be in accordance with all Ucard stated policies, including those in the Ucard Privacy Policy.<br>

        any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. A link to a non-Ucard Technology website does not mean that the Seller
        endorses or accepts any responsibility for the content or the use of such website. It is up to the Buyer to take precautions to
        ensure that whatever it selects for its use is free of such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other items of a destructive
        nature.<br>
        j. Linking to our Service<br>

        reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association,
        approval or endorsement on our part where none exists. You must not establish a link from any website that is not owned by you.<br>
        k. Headings<br>

        that breach of any of the terms in the Contract may also result in the immediate termination of the Buyers user registration
        and/or give rise to civil action against the Buyer.<br>
        n. Seller’s right of removal of materials<br>
        The Seller reserves the right at any time with or without the Buyer’s prior consent and without liability to the Buyer in that
        regard to delete from the Ucard App and/or Sites all personal information, data, text, files, images and all other materials of
        the Buyer and to prevent the Buyer from obtaining access to any such data. In particular, it is the absolute policy of the Seller
        to reject any materials which, at the Seller’s sole discretion, it considers to be obscene, in bad taste or in any other way
        inappropriate (whether or not to print such materials would be illegal or unlawful).<br>
        o. Buyer indemnification of Ucard<br>
        The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller and its affiliates, employees, agents, representatives and third party service providers,
        and to defend and hold each of them harmless, from any and all claims and liabilities (including attorneys fees) which may arise
        from the Buyer’s submissions to the Ucard app, and/or from the Buyer’s unauthorised use of material obtained through the Ucard app,
        and/or from the Buyer’s breach of the Contract, or from any other loss or damage of whatever kind suffered by the Seller caused by
        the Buyer’s use of the Ucard app.<br>
        p. Viruses, Hacking and other Offences<br>

        to orders previously placed by you), or if we notify you of the change to those policies or these terms and conditions before we send
        you the Order Confirmation (in which case we have the right to assume that you have accepted the change to the terms and conditions,

        on a regular basis should check the relevant links regularly before placing Orders. <br>
